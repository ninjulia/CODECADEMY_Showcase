# Simple Showcase Portfolio Template

This project is an exercise to create a simple 1-page portfolio site. The project was in 3 parts: design, coding and implementation.

**Design**
The design features a hero section, space for portfolio pieces in multiples of 3 and a contact section. The image for the contact section was sourced from unsplash [Dries Augustyns https://unsplash.com/photos/WzKPT0IuUrU](Dries Augustyns https://unsplash.com/photos/WzKPT0IuUrU). Icons are from the fontawesome library and fonts are via Google Fonts. Portfolio details are handled via acordion sliders on small screens and modals on larger screen sizes. Figma was used to create the design and establish colors, fonts, spacing, and other design themes.

**Code**
The design was coded in VS Code with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I first established design themeing and built the files with a mobile-first approach and made sure to incorporate accessibility techniques. To keep the modals a11y compliant, I leveraged Scott O'Harra's [Accessible Modal Dialog](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window).

**Implementation**
For this beginer project, implementation involves pushing to my github repository and establishing a live preview. This will give me an opportunity to test the layout in more devices as well as run through more accessabilty checks which require a live-site.

## Overview

### The challenge

Create a layout using HTML, CSS and JS. Additionally:

- Project Plan & Wireframe
- Use Git & Github for vs control
- Projects include photo, summary and tech used
- Contact section includes fields for name, email and message
- Include links to social
- Page must be responsive!
- Optimize for accessability

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variable properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessability / Color Contrast

### What I learned

This project was great practice for the more technical aspects of a web project. Normally I focus on design and useability, but this project forced me to get creative in how I would handle the features for accessability on the small and large UI. Modals are notoriously difficult, and I wanted to challenge myself to implement an accessability friendly one. The best option would have been to design a page for each portfolio item and link out. That of course, would have increased the page template count.

### Continued development

My implementation of the modal is a bit more kludgy than I would like. Given more time for this project I'd like to learn more how Scotta O'Hara implemented the javascript for the modal and how I might better incorporate that into my own project. I am sure the javascript that I wrote on my own could easily be refactored into smaller and more reusable functions.
